# skills
This directory will contain basic skills for JavaScript and other programming languages.  
The skills directory is the main folder on GitHub, but on your local machine, this folder will be different. 
As time progresses, you will add more directories to the skills directory.
Examples:
C#, C++, Python, etc...

NOTE:
This skills directory is set to private on Github. You can change this later if you want or fork a project to a public directory instead.
